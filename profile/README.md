## Hi there 👋

The Infectious Disease Ecology and Modelling team led by [Professor Nick Golding](https://github.com/goldingn), combines mathematical and statistical modelling, ecology, and public health to address malaria and other infectious and vector-borne diseases. 
The team uses modelling and maps to measure the risk posed by some of the world’s most important and neglected diseases – including malaria, Japanese Encephalitis Virus and Covid-19 – and provide rapid modelling analyses to policy makers.
